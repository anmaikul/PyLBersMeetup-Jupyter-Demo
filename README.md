# Synopsis

The purpose of this repository, specifically the Jupyter_Notebook_Demonstration.ipynb file contained within, is to:

1. Describe what jupyter notebook is.
2. Show how to navigate the jupyter notebook web application.
3. Preview a small set of functionality to demonstrate the kinds of things you can do using jupyter notebook.

All of this is provided inside a jupyter notebook file itself, and is meant to be run, one cell at a time, to see the results of each code block interatively.

The notebook was generated and run on Python 2.7.

# Necessary items

In order to open and run the notebook, the jupyter notebook application must be installed. If Python was installed using Anaconda, you shoud be good to go. If not, install with ```pip``` in the terminal:

```pip install jupyter```

In addition, the notebook uses the numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, IPython, and seaborn libraries. Again, if needed, install by running the command:

```pip install (package name)```

# How to open, and run

First, download the Jupyter_Notebook_Demonstration.ipynb file, along with the logo.png, notebook.css files, and place in the same directory.

The simplest way is to open the Jupyter notebook application by calling the command:

```jupyter notebook```

From there, you can use the dashboard to navigate to wherever you placed the .ipynb file, and click on that to open the notebook.
